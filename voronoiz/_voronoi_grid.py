"""
`voronoi_grid` is for displaying a Voronoi diagram of points in
the plane as an image.
It samples a grid of points and generates an array of integers
that indicate the index in the given `points` array that is
closest to the grid point.  It uses `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`
to compute the distance, so any metric provided by that function
can be used.  `voronoi_grid` requires SciPy.
